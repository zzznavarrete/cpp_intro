/*
But what if we have a pointer and want to access the value stored in that address? 
That process is called dereferencing, and it is indicated by adding the operator * before the variable's name. 
This same operator should be used to declare a variable that is meant to store a pointer.



//For example:

*/

#include <iostream>

int main(){

    // this is an integer variable with value = 54
    int a = 54; 

    // this is a pointer that holds the address of the variable 'a'.
    // if 'a' was a float, rather than int, so should be its pointer.
    int * pointerToA = &a;  

    // If we were to print pointerToA, we'd obtain the address of 'a':
    std::cout << "pointerToA stores " << pointerToA << '\n';

    // If we want to know what is stored in this address, we can dereference pointerToA:
    std::cout << "pointerToA points to " << * pointerToA << '\n';

    return 0;
