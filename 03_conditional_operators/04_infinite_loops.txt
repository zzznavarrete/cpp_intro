Infinite Loops

Sometimes it is desired to create an infinite loop. For example, in embedded systems a infinite loop is often used for the main task.

To create an infinite loop using a for loop: for( ; ;) { std::cout<<"This for loop will run forever\n"; }

To create an infinite loop using a while loop: while(1) { std::cout<<"This while loop will run forever\n"; }
